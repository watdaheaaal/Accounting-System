Accounting System (Double-Entry Bookkeeping Application)
Project Overview
This is a desktop application developed using Java Swing, designed to simulate a complete and functional double-entry bookkeeping system for a small proprietorship. Its main objective is to automate the entire accounting cycle—from journalizing transactions to generating the final Balance Sheet.

Key Features
Strict Double-Entry Enforcement: The system requires that every transaction must have a balanced Debit and Credit entry.

Complete Accounting Cycle Simulation: Includes all essential components of the accounting workflow:

Journal (Chronological record)
Ledger (Per-account T-account activity with a Running Balance)
Chart of Accounts (Master list of all accounts)
Balance Sheet (Primary financial position report)

Data Persistence: All transactions and accounts can be reliably Saved and Loaded using Java Serialization (.dat file format).

Modern UI/UX: Utilizes custom Java Swing rendering for a clean and professional display of financial data and reports.
